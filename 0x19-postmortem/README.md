<h3>Issue Summary:</h3>

Duration of Outage: 12:00 PM - 2:00 PM UTC, on January 20th, 2023.

Impact: Our beloved web application, serving several thousands of users, experienced a two-hour nap. All users were unable to access the application, leading to a 100% impact. Sorry, folks!

Root Cause: The root cause of the outage was a software bug that sneaked into the latest deployment.

<h3>Timeline:</h3>

12:05 PM UTC - The issue was detected by our trusty monitoring system, who sounded the alarm.
12:10 PM UTC - The operations team sprang into action to investigate the issue.
12:15 PM UTC - The team initially thought the issue was related to a database connectivity problem, but after investigating the database logs, they realized... nope, it's not the database's fault.
12:30 PM UTC - The team continued their search and discovered that the issue was actually caused by a bug in the application layer.
12:45 PM UTC - The incident was escalated to the development team, who got to work on fixing the issue.
2:00 PM UTC - The bug was squished, and the application was back up and running. Hooray!
Root Cause and Resolution:

The root cause of the issue was a software bug that was introduced during the latest deployment. The bug caused the application to crash when a specific user input was received. The development team worked tirelessly to fix the bug and deployed a patch to the production environment. After the patch was deployed, the application was tested and brought back online.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

The development team will perform thorough regression testing before any future deployment to avoid similar issues.
The operations team will monitor the application logs more closely to detect any issues promptly.
The development team will implement automated tests to validate the application's stability after each deployment.
A hotfix process will be established to ensure that any critical issues can be fixed quickly in the future.
Tasks:

Perform thorough regression testing before deployment.
Monitor the application logs more closely.
Implement automated tests to validate the application's stability.
Establish a hotfix process for critical issues.
And remember, it's always a good idea to have a backup plan!
